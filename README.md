<h1>jquery_filestyle</h1>

jQuery plugin for styling file input elements.

Project is a fork from  <a href="https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_filestyle">tuupola / jquery_filestyle</a>

<h2>Changes</h2>

Support for latest version of jQuery 1.9 has been added as the original project doesn't work well with it because of the (now removed) $.browser api.
